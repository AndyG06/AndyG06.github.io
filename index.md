## My Favorite Labs of CPSC 120L 

* Lab 1, part 1 

    This was a fun and stressful lab for me. I enjoyed it obviously because it was our first ever lab and we learned how to print out things, but also stressful because it meant that we were going to do more difficult assignments. Overall, I liked this lab because it introduced me to coding and collaborating with others. 


* Lab 3, part 1 

    This lab was my second favorite lab because It introduced us more to variables and doubles. This lab was more on the challenging side, so I had to reflect on my notes to help my partner work and finish the lab. In the end, I liked that the lab was with numbers since it meant that we had to calculate more.  


* Lab 4, Part 2 

    This lab was my third favorite because it was sort of like a game. We created a program in which we had to set a secret number and the user had to guess that number based on the hints that were provided. In this lab, we learned how to use if and else statements alongside variables and regular print statements.
